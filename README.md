# Data-Structure-Project-IV
Implementing Dijkstra’s	and	Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms 




# Summary
This project is an application for	Implementing Dijkstra’s	and	Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest path between two cities.

# Specifications
You	should	read	the	data	from	the	given	file	cities.txt and	then	construct	the	shortest	path	between	a	given	city	(input	from	the	user)	and	a	destination	city	 (input	 from	 the	 user). You	 should	 print	the	 full path	 using	 both	algorithms	and	the	total	distance	for	Dijkstra’s	algorithm.
The	menu	should	include	the	following	information:	
1. Load	cities:	loads	the	file	and	construct	the	graph	
2. Enter	source:	read	the	source	city	
3. Enter	destination:	print	the	full	route	of	the	shortest	path	including	the	distance	between	each	two	cities	and	the	total	shortest	cost	for	both	algorithms	(Dijkstra	and	BFS)
4. Exit:	prints	the	information	of	step	3	to	a	file	called shortest_distance.txt	and exits	the	program
